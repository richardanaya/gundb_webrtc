# WebRTC with Distributed Signalling

A demonstration of WebRTC using distributed storage (GunDB) as signalling.

How's this work.  I used GunDB (a distributed key value store) to act like a channeling system just long enough to connect two WebRTC peers with each other.

Want to see a demo?

You're going to need a STUN server first.
